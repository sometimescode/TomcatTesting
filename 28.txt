About.jsp
Struts -> action -> data from the action (.java) is passed as result -> displayed in .jsp
Struts 2 -> each action should have an execute function. And it will always return a String because that's what's checked in
results tag.
---
Login Scenario
Index -> Struts -> Login.java -> Login.jsp -> request -> struts > Login.java can return values on execute() ->
from struts, it will run the appropriate .jsp based on result name
ex. Login.java's execute returns "regular", in struts, under Login action,
<result name="regular"></result> gets chosen
---
Activity have an array of 5 sentences "This is sample [x]" where x is 1 to 5.
Load page depending on result of random;
in this case you have max and min (x + y) in Math.floor(Math.random())
---
Forms
s:form tag has action and namespace (optional)
ex. <s:form action="" namespace=""></s:form>
Use namespace where your jsp is located
textfield tag has key and value, we'll use key today
If form sends to .java, it will set the attribute used in key in that .java file
---
s:property calls getter on value
s:textfield calls setter on key
