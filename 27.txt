Webapp folder contains UI (jsps and html), java folder contains action classes (whatever classes are going to process requests e.g About.java) - controller
resources folder contains roots of struts project

User wants to access -> index.jsp (java servlet pages, which is templating) which displays data from action files
User wants to access another page -> it goes to struts -> looks for the action -> give a result (.jsp) -> display the UI

Activity 
Currently we have index.jsp and struts. And we made About.java and About.jsp
Create an Action and a JSP.
Put content in all 3.

To make the new page:
add a new action in struts
create the jsp and java files

Action file for About.jsp is About.java
About.jsp can access attributes in About.java
<s:property> tag access properties from the java associated with the jsp
